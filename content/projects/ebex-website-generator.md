description: "eBex is a SaaS platform that enables users to create one-page websites quickly by selecting templates and filling out forms. This method is more efficient than traditional drag-and-drop builders and offers better engagement than basic profile creators. 

To address user drop-off rates, we streamlined template requirements with predefined color schemes, auto-generated logos, stock images, and hidden empty sections. For less tech-savvy users, we introduced skippable mini-tours and a new onboarding process that collects website data post-sign-up, improving user success rates. 

As the UI/UX Lead, I identified user pain points, implemented data-driven solutions, and tested enhancements, resulting in significant improvements in user retention and satisfaction."
