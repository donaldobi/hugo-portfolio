# Projects

This page serves as an overview of all projects. In Hugo, the `_index.md` file in a folder is used to create a list page for that section. For the projects folder, this file defines the metadata and potentially content for the main projects page, which typically displays a list or grid of all individual project entries.

The front matter above sets:
- The title of the page
- The creation date
- The draft status (false means it's ready to be published)
- A description of what this page does
- The layout to be used (list, which is typical for index pages)

Individual project pages will be listed automatically on this page, based on the Hugo theme and layout configurations.
